# Zeno's Transfer Utility
An utility for dumping files from your device(you have to choose an exact folder from directory_1 to directory_2). Just in a few clicks.

# HOW TO START USING IT

Go to releases, then download it, unzip and:
Do a right-click on start.bat, then click Edit, and change Your_Direction_To_Python.exe to the path of python.exe
P.S. Python Installer often installs it to Your_Home_Partition:/Users/User_Name/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/PythonXX(your_version)/

ALSO! Make a test with test files, because if there will be a mistake, I really don't know what can happen.

P.P.S. Made with using Python 3.9.2
